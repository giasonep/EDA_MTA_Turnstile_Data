# EDA of MTA Turnstile Data
Metis EDA Module 1 Project

## ABSTRACT
The goal of this module was to use the most recent three months of MTA Turnstile data to determine the optimal geographical placement of Women Tech Women Yes’ (“WTWY”) Street Team to best collect email contacts from passersby who may be interested in their organization, its mission, and their annual gala. I grouped MTA turnstile data by total daily passages for each station. I used station location relative to the nearest universities’ STEM departments as well as specific times and days to find the most optimal locations for WTWY to gain exposure to interested populations. From the hours of 9 AM-4 PM on Tuesdays through Fridays, I recommended that WTWY station their Street Team at 14 St.-Union Sq. to gain exposure to Baruch College and heavy foot traffic. From the hours of 7-10 PM on Wednesdays through Fridays, I recommended that WTWY station their Street Team at W 4 St.-Washington Sq. to gain exposure to NYU and heavy foot traffic. And finally, from the hours of 9 AM-4 PM on Mondays, I recommended that WTWY station their Street Team at Flatbush Av.-B.C. to gain exposure to Brooklyn College.
